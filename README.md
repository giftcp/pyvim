#### Overview

This Docker image provides a complete Python development environment with **LazyVim** pre-installed and fully configured. The goal is to offer a ready-to-use container that allows you to start coding in Python immediately, without any manual setup.

#### Purpose

The main objective is to streamline the development workflow by:

- Preinstalling and configuring LazyVim as the IDE.
- Optimizing LazyVim for Python development out of the box.
- Eliminating the initial plugin download process that typically occurs when LazyVim is first launched in a new container.

#### Problem Addressed

In most containerized Vim or Neovim setups, LazyVim begins downloading and installing plugins when the container is first started. This delays development and consumes unnecessary bandwidth during container runtime. This image resolves that by preloading all required plugins, so the environment is fully functional upon startup.

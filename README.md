#### Python Vim

This docker image creates a container that has a complete development environment containing LazyVim and Python.

The idea is to have a container that you can just spin up and start developing in python with the ide in this case LazyVim already installed and optimized for python development.

There was is usually an issue with these setups. When the container is launched. LazyVim starts downloading plugins. I would like to eliminate this process and have everything ready as soon as the container is launched.
